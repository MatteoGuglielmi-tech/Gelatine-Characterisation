# Ultrasound-Assigment
In this specific repository, you can find a possible solution to characetrize the acoustic properties of an unknown medium. The experimetns were conduced inside the ULTRa Labortory in University of Trento, Italy. In particular, the code is meant to carry out the following requests :
- compute an estimation of the acoustic SOS in the medium
- estimate the attenuation coefficient of the gelatine as a function of depth and frequency
